      href="https://wevotesafely.org/">the main page</a> to geolocate your device and
      look up the nearest safe voting locations in your county. Alternatively, you

      <p class="FAQItem" id="help"><b>I am getting an error or nothing happens when I tap on the green button. Can you help me?</b></p>

      <p class="FAQItem">The green button accesses geolocation services on your device. 
      You may have those geolocation services turned off. If nothing happens when you 
      click the green button, simply just type your address into the text box just below

      <p class="FAQItem">The site is a resource designed and built by a
      variety of volunteers from across the country who believe that every person in
      the United States should have one-click access to information that can help
      them exercise their Constitutional right to vote <b><i><u>safely</u></i></b>
      during the unprecedented health crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

      <p class="FAQItem">Many people in this country can take advantage
      of ballot drop boxes, early voting sites, county
      election offices, and other similar options for delivering their
      mail-in/absentee ballot personally by hand to election officials. Given the
      expansion of vote-by-mail and absentee voting in many states due to COVID-19,
      we want to simplify the information gathering process for every voter in the United
      States to eliminate voter confusion and ballot disqualification.</p>

      <p class="FAQItem" id="ZipCode"><b><mark>Why can I not use my zip code? Why do I have to use my full address?</mark></b></p>

      <p class="FAQItem">What a smart question you ask! Elections in the United States are run by county authorities.
      Your active voter registration is on file in one (and only one) county. However, zip codes can (and sometimes do) span more
      than one county. In fact, a few zip codes even span more than one state! But don't just take our word for it, you can
      verify this for yourself and read more fun facts about US zip codes <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_Code">here</a>.
      With this in mind, a zip code by itself is simply not enough information for us to be able to give you accurate information on 
      where your county's safe voting locations are. In short,  we cannot accurately determine your county from your zip code. Although there are some situations
      across the United States where a ballot belonging to one county and is deposited into another county's system can potentially
      be forwarded to the correct county, the risk of that ballot potentially going uncounted is quite high. We're guessing that your interest
      in this question comes from your concern about privacy considerations. If that is true, we think you will like our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. 
      If you don't believe our privacy policy, we recommend that you use your next-door neighbor's address. ;) Now that we have this out of the way, you may want 
      to <a href="default.html">return to the main page</a> so that you can find your safe voting locations.</p>
