		<h3>Who and what is <a href="https://wevotesafely.org/">https://WeVoteSafely.org</a></h3>

		<p>The site is a resource designed and built by a
		variety of volunteers from across the country who believe that every person in
		the United States should have one-click access to information that can help
		them exercise their Constitutional right to vote <b><i><u>safely</u></i></b>
		during the unprecedented health crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

		<p>Many people in this country can take advantage
		of ballot drop boxes, early voting sites, county
		election offices, and other similar options for delivering their
		mail-in/absentee ballot personally by hand to election officials. Given the
		expansion of vote-by-mail and absentee voting in many states due to COVID-19,
		we want to simplify the information gathering process for every voter in the United
		States to eliminate voter confusion and ballot disqualification.</p>

		<h3>How did you build this?</h3>

		<p>We have <a href="how-we-built-this.html">an entire page devoted to this topic</a>.</p>

		<h3 id="verifiable">Why should I trust this data?</h3>

		<p>We will allow selected non-partisan and/or news organizations to examine our code, data, infrastructure,
		and/or methods to the extent that any such examination does not compromise the security measures that
		we have in place for the systems.</p>

		<p>We believe that it is ALWAYS a best practice to NOT blindly
		believe something you happen to read on the Internet. That is even
		(especially!) true with information on voting for the following reasons:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Unfortunately, you cannot trust everything you see/hear online without independent validation</li>
			<li>Voting details (including locations of specific ballot drop-off boxes, early
			voting locations, and election day polling sites) are subject to change
			between now and election day, especially as COVID-19 conditions change. We
			will do our best to update our information here as details change. If you
			believe that you have more accurate information, please let us know&nbsp;<a
			href="mailto:wevotesafely@gmail.com?subject=Errors%20and%20Omissions%20Found">here</a>. We welcome your contribution!</li>
			<li>Honest people make mistakes sometimes. This is a human-curated, crowdsourced search engine
			and there is a LOT of cutting/pasting that went into building this site. we
			might have missed something along the way. Errors/Omissions: if you do
			find an error/omission or updated information, please let us know&nbsp;<a
			href="mailto:wevotesafely@gmail.com?subject=Errors%20and%20Omissions%20Found">here</a>.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>To help you in the process of verifying&nbsp;<a
		href="https://wevotesafely.org/">our voter information</a>, <b>every location
		on our maps include a link back to the original city/county/state source of
		official information so that you can validate for yourself that the information
		is correct</b>. More than ever, democracy is in your hands. <a href="default.html">Take me back to the main page now</a>.</p>

		<h3>What technologies are you using?</h3>

		<p>We use best-of-breed services from Google and Microsoft,
		although our usage of these technologies is not an endorsement of any kind from
		either of those companies.</p>

		<h3>What is your privacy policy?</h3>

		<p>We do NOT collect personally identifiable information.
		Full details are <a href="./privacy.html">here</a>. If
		you do not believe our policy in this regard, feel free to use a nearby
		address for locating nearest safe voting locations. :) </p>

		<h3>I do not see data for my area. What is up with that?</h3>

		<p>In some cases, states and/or counties have not yet published
		their information. In other cases, we have not yet collected, standardized, geocoded,
		and published information that election authorities have published. We do
		expect to have a complete set of data published here by the end of the second
		week in October.</p>

		<h3>What are the terms and conditions of using this site?</h3>

		<p>In some cases, states and/or counties have not yet published

		<h3 id="ZipCode">Why can I not use my zip code? Why do I have to use my full address?</h3>

		<p>What a smart question you ask! Elections in the United States are run by county authorities.
		Your active voter registration is on file in one (and only one) county. However, zip codes can (and sometimes do) span more
		than one county. In fact, a few zip codes even span more than one state! But don't just take our word for it, you can
		verify this for yourself and read more fun facts about US zip codes <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_Code">here</a>.
		With this in mind, a zip code by itself is simply not enough information for us to be able to give you accurate information on
		where your county's safe voting locations are. In short,  we cannot accurately determine your county from your zip code. Although there are some situations
		across the United States where a ballot belonging to one county and is deposited into another county's system can potentially
		be forwarded to the correct county, the risk of that ballot potentially going uncounted is quite high. We're guessing that your interest
		in this question comes from your concern about privacy considerations. If that is true, we think you will like our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
		If you don't believe our privacy policy, we recommend that you use your next-door neighbor's address. ;) Now that we have this out of the way, you may want
		to <a href="default.html">return to the main page</a> so that you can find your safe voting locations.</p>
